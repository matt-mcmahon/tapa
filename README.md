# Tapas

In **Spanish**, *tapas* are small-plate cuisines that can be combined to make a full meal.
In **Node**, *tapas* are functional unit-tests that combine to make robust framework for testing modules and applications.

## Important!
This framework is experimental.
It's not currently in a state that's usable by other modules.
I encourage you to fork this module, check-out the code, and provide feedback on what I'm doing,
but it's not (yet) in a state where you can use it to unit-test your own modules.
